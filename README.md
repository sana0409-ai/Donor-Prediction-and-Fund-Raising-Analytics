# Donor-Prediction-and-Fund-Raising-Analytics

Machine learning models to predict donors and optimize nonprofit fundraising.

Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on direct mail campaigns to solicit donations. However, mass-mailing to every potential donor often results in low response rates and negative ROI due to mailing costs.

This project focuses on developing predictive analytics models to improve the efficiency of fundraising campaigns. By predicting who is likely to donate and how much they may contribute, nonprofits can make informed decisions about targeting the right individuals, reducing costs, and maximizing returns.
Classification Models

Purpose: Identify whether an individual is a likely donor (donr).

Models applied: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forest.

Business goal: Maximize true donors reached while minimizing wasted mailings.

Regression Models

Purpose: Estimate expected donation amounts (damt).

Models applied: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Multiple Linear Regression.

Business goal: Refine targeting by prioritizing high-value donors.

Evaluation Metrics

Classification: Misclassification rate, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy.

Regression: Average Squared Error (ASE), variance explained.
Dataset

Size: 6,002 observations × 20 variables.

Target Variables:

donr → binary outcome (1 = donor, 0 = non-donor).

damt → donation amount in USD.

Predictor Variables: Demographics (income, region, wealth index, home value), household information, historical donation behavior, and promotional exposure.

Balance: Donors and non-donors equally represented.

Data Quality: No missing values, limited outliers handled analytically.
